# Compute-Game-of-Life
This is a program I created to teach myself the basics of compute shaders. As the name suggests it's Conway's Game of Life written using computational shaders.
When running the program the user can press on the screen where they want to toggle a cell between alive and dead.
The size of the cells can be changed by changing the Scale property in the main script attached to the camera. Here you can also change the frequency of turns.
